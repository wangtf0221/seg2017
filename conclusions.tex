\section{Conclusion}

We have proposed a local angle domain tomography method based on azimuth-preserved phase-angle domain PSTM. 

Residual tomographic inversion is an effective tool for
estimation of velocity structure Proper formulation of the
method produces an accurate and rapidly converging
algorithm.
